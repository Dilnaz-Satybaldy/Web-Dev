<!--Block-level Elements-->
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

  The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

    The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

    The <p> element is a block-level element.

      The <div> element is a block-level element.
      <p>Hello World</p>
      <div>Hello World</div>

<!--Inline Elements-->
      An inline element does not start on a new line.

      An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

      This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
        <span>Hello World</span>

        <!--The <div> Element-->
        The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
              <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>

</div>
<!--The <span> Element-->
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
                    <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span
                            style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
